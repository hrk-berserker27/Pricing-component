![Design preview for the Interactive pricing component coding challenge](./Next-app/public/design/My%20site.png)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution for the Interactive pricing component coding challenge.

## Tools used to build this app

- Next.js
- React
- SASS
- CSS Flexbox

## What I learned while taking on this challenge

- I learned how to design input tag which is of type "range".
- I had to really work on my designing skills and this challenge really tested my responsive designing skills.
- I got to work on SASS and different designing techniques to mirror the design which was given alongwith the challenge.
- The JavaScript logic was simple but helped me understand dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute in react.
- Learnt how to scale SVG
- Learnt how to use SVG with pseudo elements
